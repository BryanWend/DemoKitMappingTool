# Demo-Kit-Mapping-Tool

## Goal

Create an easy tool that maps out the insides of a Pelican 1510 case for consistent recreation of physical demonstration units

### Additional Notes

Sizes must be hard-coded to ensure it meets exact measurements for physical accuracy.

## Current Progress

There is two total canvases with Canvas One being completed.

 - Canvas One, the top canvas, is used to map component locations with the case.
 - Canvas Two, the bottom canvas, is used to map out the specific grid squares that are required to be cut out of the case.

## To Do

- [ ] The bottom canvas is able to create shapes on click but cannot immediately place them into the grid layout.  They have to be moved into a space in order to snap to grid.
- [ ] Shape object declaration for multiple canvases can be simplified through use of array and a for loop with constructor because values must be hardcoded intially.
- [ ] Additional CSS Styling
- [ ] \(Optional) Include a third canvas to map out bottom layer of internals.  Canvas One only includes the top layer of required components
